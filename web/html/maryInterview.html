        <p class="intro">
          Whilst planning to build my website I emailed Mary Holm, for her
          insight into basic financial education. I asked her three questions
          and she kindly replied with her thoughts. The interview is below.

      <!--This is the Question and Answer for Question 1-->
      <div class="InterviewQ1">
        <p class="q1">
          1. Why is it important that financial freedom is taught in New Zealand
          schools?
        </p>
        <p class="a1">
          Knowing about money is not like knowing about sport or music or
          movies. If you're not interested in those, you can get by just fine.
          But if you don't understand how money works, you're likely to end up
          with less of the things that make life work well, like good food,
          housing, transport, clothes etc. Also, importantly, money problems
          often lead to relationship problems. While money in itself doesn't
          really make people happy, it enables happiness.

      <!--This is the Question and Answer for Question 2-->
      <div class="interviewQ2">
        <p class="q2">
          2. Do you have any rule of thumb for how to spend your income?
          especially when young and living on a budget.
        </p>
        <p class="a2">
          It's quite simple: don't spend more than you earn! And if you save for
          what you want - rather than using a "buy now pay later" plan - not
          only will you not waste money on fees and other charges, but also
          you'll have time to think about whether you really want that item. A
          lot of the stuff we buy on impulse is not stuff we value for long.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!--This is the Question and Answer for Question 3-->
      <div class="interviewQ3">
        <p class="q3">
          3. In these uncertain times many teens & young adults feel scared to
          put their income anywhere except their savings account. What would you
          say to these people?
        </p>
        <p class="a3">
          The money you expect to spend in the next year or two or three is best
          kept in a bank account or a bank term deposit, even though the
          interest is low. But if you're saving for, say, a first home, and you
          don't expect to buy in less than ten years, it's good to save it in a
          higher-risk KiwiSaver fund - a balanced, growth or even aggressive
          account - and stick with it over the years. Your balance will - not
          might but will! - go down sometimes, but in the long run your money
          will grow a lot more than in the bank.
