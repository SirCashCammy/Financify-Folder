        Hi Im Cam, the author of this website. Although it was part of Year 13 Digital Technology. Personal finance for young people has always been a passion of mine. So when the time came to create an outcome about the topic, I jumped at the opportunity with little to none coding knowledge. As I am not a trained financial advisor I am unable to give financial advice yet I have been able to create a website which prompts users to think about their financial habits. I have learnt lots about financial literacy and coding. This project has prompted me to study computer science and finance next year and Otago university.
        Enjoy the read, Cam
